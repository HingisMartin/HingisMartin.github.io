Method 1 : 
tried with flask server.
This doesn't work because Github only servers static content. Finding alternative to run it.
Method 2 : 
PHP/JS code to load nav bar on each page
but cross origin request error. chrome/edge don't support. solution is to install IIS.


Makeshift :  hardcoded.
Have to improvise.
