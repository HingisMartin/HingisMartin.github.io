My Journey : of being alone.
1. I Love to be alone but not always.
    The fact that it bothers me troubles me alot.I sometimes love to eat alone. But I have also troubled my friends to eat with me because I hate to eat alone. Contradictory right.
   With every friend of mine I have known ,dislike something about me. I'm always ready to blame myself. I know I feel weak and less confident but I know I can change and with time I will.
   Lot of people have choose not to spend time with me. Recently also, I met one guy who is struggling with his own life. Trying to figure out his career, I know how much tough it is.
   But all I wanted was to be there emotionally. But he misunderstood my intentions and his words cut deep. But I choose not to make his life more troublesome. But I'm having hard time
   I can't talk to him. I definitely felt insulted because of his words. But still I want to be kind towards him afterall he is 2 years younger than me. I can't expect a kid to be all
   mature and act like grown up right. But idk why my heart is having hard time expecting the fact that how within 1-2 weeks people pretend to know me. Without even having a proper
   conversation, how can one judge me. Anyways maybe I expected more from him. See there I go blaming myself.
   
2. My days with charlie : My uncle's dog
  To be honest, I think I'm not kind as I thought I'm. I can't love animals. I can't be kind towards them. But seriously it's not fair. I hate dogs tbh. But my brother-in-law told me if I
  spend time with them,it might change my opinions. I tried to accept dogs as part of my life because every person I love has a dog. And as usual my family doesn't consider me as 
  human. My opinions are shit. No one listens. So I have to adjust. That's one of the reason I don't want to go back to India. Anyways ,DOGS... I seriously didn't expect to see this version
  of me. But all I wondered was will I treat a baby so badly in a heartless manner. I hope God gives me patience. I want to be kind irrespective of how people/animals treat me.
  I want to shower love so that no human has to feel lonely , unloved, unvalued like me.

3. How I handled my friends death : count of suicide before me : 2
  Death is a cruel thing. Leaves a hole behind. I failed as a friend when he choose to take his life. Idk why, do people see through me ? Ik I sometimes pretend to be kind when inside
  my heart I'll be crusing. Tbh I do it out of anger not intended. That's I upress that version of me , which wants to give 2-3 galli and scold people for being a selfish jerk.
  Anyyways, even after 6 months, I miss him. But I'm glad I remember his smile. You know his sister-in-law told me : among his friends I knew him and spent more time with him. But
  sadly he choose not to take my help. How difficult it is to accept the death of someone. Even though we survived COVID, depression is something that kills us, even before it's obvious
  it might be too late. I still feel I should have held his hand tightly. Should have told him that he is doing great and he is amazing. Hope is something it's tough to built.
  This world is definitely cruel. I have shed so many tears but never found an answer to ease someone's pain. That's the whole reason why I sometimes pretend to be kind. Ik there will
  be people in my life who will misuse me. But if I can save 1 person from not choosing death, I can died happily.
  TBH, I still can't accept his death. I wonder where he is and how he is ?
5. My dream
   My dreams are so not practical. Idk I think I should be mother Terasa or Ida s. scudder. I want to help people not choose death even though this world is full of evilness.
   I want them to live. If someone asked me why? IDK the answer. IDK living doesn't make sense to me either. I mean what are we even doing ? Our existence is so meaningless.
   Then why we want to live ? We are so selfish creature. Without any reason or purpose we still want to live.
